'''
2.4 Partition:
Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.
If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x (see below).
The partition element x can appear anywheree in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
EXAMPLE
Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition=5]
Output: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8

'''
- two pointers - one for L, one for R.
- create a new linked list.
- move L until the end and add, then R.

OR

- one pointer.
- create 2 new linked lists - one for L, one for R.
- move pointer and append to respective lists.
- join the lists.
