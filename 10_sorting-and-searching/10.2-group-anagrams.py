10.2 Group Anagrams:
Write a method to sort an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next to each other.

'''
[ santa, satan, mono, moon ]

- how do we know they are anagrams of each other? they have the same character counts.
- assuming length of word is k, if we sort it alphabetically, it's k log k. n words. so, O(n * k log k), then put into dictionary.
- alternatively:
    - count frequencies of each word O(n * k)
    - for each word, compare to the item in the dictionary. O(n)
